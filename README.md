# SwapSort

[![Build Status](https://github.com/putianyi889/SwapSort.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/putianyi889/SwapSort.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

This package is intended to be a successor of [SortingNetworks.jl](https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/SortingNetworks.jl). This package relies on the existing [sorters](./src/Sorters) which are currently copied from [SorterHunter](https://github.com/bertdobbelaere/SorterHunter), a C++ project. For a visualization of the algorithms, see [here](https://bertdobbelaere.github.io/sorting_networks.html).
